            <h2>Adobe Photoshop</h2>
            <p class="justifiedText">My journey started with adobe photoshop in 2019 when I was only 12 years old. I
                always enjoyed using my pc and playing, but the using photoshop was my first serious usage of computers.
                It all began when our school added a computer class to our schedule. We had a cool teacher that told us
                the basics of photoshop. He was so cool all of my classmates like his class, but I was realy impressed
                and <strong>loved it</strong> I used to make projects outside of the class and show it to him. One day
                he spoke to my parents and talked about my passion of computers. Ans so thanks to him my family were
                always helpful and supportful to me.</p>

            <p class="justifiedText">My next technology to learn was adobe premier pro 2020. This was the first time I
                was learning something on my own(self taught). It was a fantastic time. I finished a full course and did
                a lot of projects so I was comfident of myself a lot. It was found pretty helpful to me.</p>

            <p class="justifiedText">In 2021 I started using and learning Unity. This period of my life is so
                <strong>special</strong> for me, I belive it was the
                longest technology I have ever used till(about 2 years) now and because it was the
                start of programming and coding for me !(not realy cause I have learned some c++, python and some other
                programming languages after premiere but unity and c# were my first true choice and I have used them
                alot longer than them.) because of my love for game and my ideas of making AAA games. I did A lot of
                that hope I could show some of my examples to you but backthen I didn't have a clue what a <abbr
                    title="Version Control System">VCS</abbr> is, and once I was playing aruond with my laptop to open
                it's bios and I screwed up and lost every one of my hole life projects.üò≠üòÖ For unity I used Visual
                Studio
                that is a slow ass heavy weight IDE!üòÇ

            <h3>So Why Did I Quit Unity?</h3>
            <p>It was a hard time for me leaving unity and I still love gamedev, but I had 2
                problems with it:</p>
            <ol class="justifiedText">
                <li>I didn't have the computing power.</li>

            <h2>Python</h2>
            <p class="justifiedText">
                In 2023 AI was so hot and I had quite Unity so I started learning python. I didn't learn from my
                mistakes and after quiting a bad choice and started to learn another one. One of my catch phrases is
                that "I did every possible mistake so I wont do another" but I still didn't check the market and the pre
                requirements and got into python for learning machine learning. It was a good experience but I could
                have focused on better siuted things for me. But it wasn't a complete failure cause it helped me with
                cs50 and even js cause their so alike. I made a lot of cool projects in python too. I even made a voice
                assistant like jarvis using google text to speech, google speech recognition and ChatGPT. I wish I could
                show it to you but I lost it too.üò≠
            </p>
            <h3>Why Did I Quit Python</h3>
            <p class="justifiedText">I had 3 reasons for this even worse than unity.üòÇ The first two being the same, but
                the third was lack of math knowledg. Even to this day I don't have the knowledg(by this day I mean a
                year laterü§£). Don't forget I'm still in highschool atleast when I'm writing this loooong project(it
                took longer than what I expectedüòÖ).</p>

            <p class="justifiedText">What a coincidence I'm making this website for CS50! At the end of 2023 after
                realizing what a big mistake I have done I came to realize I should think about my next move. So I
                grinded the internet and found CS50. So I started learning it so far it was the best programming class I
                have ever taking although it was free!!üòÆ I made the first 8.5 weeks(including week 0) pretty
                fast(probably cause I had prior experience), I think I even broke a record(about 3 weeks I guess)! but
                when I arrived at the 8th week I stopped. I understood I should become a lot better at this part cause I
                want to specialize in this part. Ans this is the last assignment for that week.</p>

                away from it at last I got to back to it.(I have done a little bit of it before)</p>

                Flask is good cause it is taught in CS50 and I will feel better knowing all that python learning wasn't
